;
; NAME:
;  v_compute_intnum
;
; PURPOSE:
;  The Virtis-H integration time is stored in the Housekeeping packets into 2 words of 2 bytes each
;  This function computes the integration time uses given those 2 words
;  
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;  Result=v_compute_intnum(val1, val2)
;               
; INPUTS:
;  val1 = least significant word
;  val2 = most significant word
;       
; OUTPUTS:
;  Result = The translated integration time
