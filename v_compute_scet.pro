; NAME:
;  v_compute_scet
;
; PURPOSE:
;  The SCET values located in the PDS suffix are stored into 3 words of 2 bytes each
;  This function compte a SCET value given those 3 words
;  
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;  Result=v_compute_scet(val1, val2, val3)
;               
; INPUTS:
;  val1 = Most significant word
;  val2 = Middle word
;  val3 = Least significant word
;       
; OUTPUTS:
;  Result = The SCET (SpaceCraft Elapsed Time)
